# Genetic_algorithm-nurse-rostering-scheduling

## Problems
* The nurse scheduling is known to have NP-hard complexity.
* Manual shift scheduling requires certain experience.
* Scheduling results must comply with legal requirements.
* Scheduling results will take into account nurse preference.
* Using a computational search algorithm to address these problems results in cost savings and better work schedules.
